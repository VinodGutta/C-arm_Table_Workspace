# C-arm_Table_Workspace

## Overview
In this project, C-arm and patient table combined setup with higher degrees of freedom (DOF) was studied to analyze the collision-free workspace for typical interventional configurations. A six DOF C-arm was designed using standard five C-arm joints and its movement on the floor parallel to the table as the 6th DOF. This C-arm is combined with a 5 DOF surgical table with assuming their initial pose. In this 11 DOF setup, two table rotational joints were ignored, and workspace analysis was performed on the remaining 9 DOF.

Forward kinematics for this setup was solved using DH parameters. Random joint configurations were selected within the joint limits to calculate the target pose and perform workspace analysis. Target pose is the pose of C-arm end-effector w.r.t table end-effector i.e., pose of C-arm w.r.t the patient on the table. Collisions between C-arm and table will occur for many joint configurations, this is detected by developing 3D meshes and point cloud representing our setup and identifying any intersections between these C-arm and table 3D objects. Lastly, a numerical iterative inverse kinematics was performed to analyze the collision-free workspace reachability with numerical solution compared to the actual reachability.

**For collision-free workspace results and further details about our setup, please refer to our paper (to be published).**

## Interventional Configurations
Workspace analysis was performed for [six typical surgical poses](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicolas-Loy-Rodas/publication/315768326_Pose_Optimization_of_a_C-Arm_Imaging_Device_to_Reduce_Intraoperative_Radiation_Exposure_of_Staff_and_Patient_During_Interventional_Procedures/links/59dcb1d3a6fdcc1ec8a75c16/Pose-Optimization-of-a-C-Arm-Imaging-Device-to-Reduce-Intraoperative-Radiation-Exposure-of-Staff-and-Patient-During-Interventional-Procedures.pdf)

- Anterior-Posterior (AP)
- Vascular 1 (V1)
- Vascular 2 (V2)
- Vertebroplasty (Ver)
- Lateral (Lat)

## Initial pose
C-arm and table initial pose is assumed such that a vertical line passes through the C-arm and table end-effectors when all joints are configured to zero except C-arm's horizontal and table's longitudinal joints configured to their centre values. This is to ensure from the initial pose there is movement possible on either directions.
